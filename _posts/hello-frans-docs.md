To start, let's define what databases are. A database is a collection of data that is organized in a way that allows for easy access, retrieval, and manipulation of the data. Databases can be used to store a wide range of information, from customer data to product inventory and more.

There are different types of databases, including relational databases, NoSQL databases, and graph databases. Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited to different types of projects.

One of the most popular database management systems for web design is MySQL. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that is widely used in web applications.

In web design, databases are used to store user information, such as login credentials, personal details, and preferences. Databases are also used to store content, such as blog posts and product descriptions, that can be easily retrieved and displayed on a website.

As I gained more knowledge and experience with databases, I started to explore their use in app builds. Databases are essential in app development, as they are used to store and manage large amounts of data, such as user information, app content, and app settings.

In addition to learning how to use databases in web design and app builds, I also focused on best practices for database security, backup, and recovery. These are critical aspects of database management that ensure data remains secure and accessible even in the event of a disaster.
